<h2 id="limited-usefulness-of-normality-tests">Limited Usefulness of Normality Tests</h2>

<p>The Shapiro-Wilk and <a href="https://www.spss-tutorials.com/spss-kolmogorov-smirnov-test-for-normality/">Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</a> both examine if a variable is normally distributed in some population. But why even bother? Well, that&#39;s because many statistical tests -including <a href="https://www.spss-tutorials.com/anova-what-is-it/">ANOVA</a>, <a href="https://www.spss-tutorials.com/t-test/">t-tests</a> and <a href="https://www.spss-tutorials.com/simple-linear-regression/">regression</a>- require the <strong>normality assumption</strong>: variables must be normally distributed in the population. However,	
<span class="def">the normality assumption is only needed for small sample sizes</span>
of -say- N ? 20 or so. For larger sample sizes, the <a href="https://www.spss-tutorials.com/sampling-distribution-what-is-it/">sampling distribution</a> of the mean is always normal, regardless how values are distributed in the population. This phenomenon is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a>. And the consequence is that many test results are unaffected by even severe violations of normality.<br/>
So if sample sizes are reasonable, normality tests are often <strong>pointless</strong>. Sadly, few statistics instructors seem to be aware of this and still bother students with such tests. And that&#39;s why I wrote this tutorial anyway.</p>

<p>Hey! But what if sample sizes are small, say N &lt; 20 or so? Well, in that case, many tests <em>do</em> require normally distributed variables. However, 
<span class="def">normality tests typically have low power in small sample sizes.</span>
As a consequence, even substantial deviations from normality may not be statistically significant. So when you really need normality, normality tests are unlikely to detect that it&#39;s actually violated. Which renders them pretty useless.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
